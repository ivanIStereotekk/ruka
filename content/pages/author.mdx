    Ivan Goncharov - Sound producer and disc jockey with about 20 years of
    experience in sound production. He began his activity as a disc jockey at
    the very end of the nineties in a huge and modern southern city of russia
    Rostov On Don. The series of parties that were initiated with the friends
    was incredibly successful for ten years. Later, he completely switched to
    studio work, experimenting in such genres as house/techno. In 2006, Ivan
    started releasing on independent record labels as an artist Ivan Stereotekk.
    His musical taste often changes taking on distinct features from the
    American house to deep German techno and minimalistic sound. It's always
    sounds like flirting with the muse, it's always a bright palette of melodies
    and groove.

    It's interesting to watch this artist grow and change, how his sound moves
    in rhythm with technology. One of Ivan's main futures is experimenting with
    code and experimenting with technologies. Extracted from high-tech
    solutions, what is new always sounds more than the interest that can become
    revolutionary. Referring to the words spoken by Frankie Zappa, "Without
    deviation from the norm, progress is not possible..."
