    Ivan Goncharov - Sound producer and disc jockey with about 20 years of
    experience in sound production. He was grew up in Tbilisi/Georgia then began
    his activity as a disc jockey at the end of the nineties in a big southern
    city of russia Rostov On Don. The series of parties that he was initiated
    with the friends been incredibly successful for many many years. Later, he
    completely switched to studio work, started experimenting in such genres as
    house/techno/minimal/electronic. Since 2006, Ivan started releasing on
    independent record label as an artist Ivan Stereotekk. He's musical taste
    often changes taking on distinct features from the american house or deep
    german techno and romanian minimalistic sound. Bright palette of melodies
    and grooves trough the noizy dark room.

    It's interesting to see that artist grow and change, how his sound moves in
    rhythm with technology and self evolution. One of Ivan's lovely thing is
    experimenting with coding and technologies. Extracted from high-tech
    solutions, what is new always sounds more than the interest that can become
    revolutionary. Referring to the words spoken by Frankie Zappa, "Without
    deviation from the norm, progress is not possible..." Stay tuned !
