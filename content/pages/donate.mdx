    Today was a productive day so that made me satisfied. I implemented body
    detection that works well. Experimenting with this AI and video analysis
    technologies have shown that the main requirement is to have good hardware.
    I did some exploration for the developer kits and small prototyping
    computers that will help me to raise my project and found the best solution
    for it and it seems to me it is Jetson Nano series computers from NVIDIA. It
    is quite expensive and it's only a small part of the expenses that I want to
    put into this project. As the next step of my project I want to build a MIDI
    controller app using Brain Computer Interface. Just imagine you thinking
    about the music and it plays. You are showing gestures to your computer and
    it plays ... That's my idea. I love it !

    I would love to rely on the help and support of the community to raise the
    necessary funds to implement this project. If you like my ideas and are
    ready to participate financially in the project, then I am always glad to
    see you. Write a letter or message in one of the apps if you have any
    suggestion or ask a question. I will be happy to keep in touch with you,
    listen to a good idea or accept a valuable suggestion.
